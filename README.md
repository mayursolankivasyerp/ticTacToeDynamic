# Tic Tac Toe NxN

A fun Tic Tac Toe game made with React. You can choose the size of the grid (N x N) and play the game. The rules for winning, losing, and drawing work just like the classic 3x3 game but adjusted for any grid size.

## Features

- **Adjustable Grid Size:** Enter a number to set the grid size.
- **Classic Game Play:** Win, lose, and draw functionality scaled for any grid.
- **Interactive UI:** Click on the cells to make your move.

## How to Use

1. **Set Grid Size:** Type a number in the input field to change the grid size.
2. **Play the Game:** Click on the cells to place your X or O.
3. **See Results:** The game will show who won or if it's a draw.

## Notes
